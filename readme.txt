## Why use Next.js?

- Simplifies building full‑stack apps compared to SPAs.

## Main benefits

- **Full‑stack by default**
  - Data fetching and rendering are easier.
  - Backend and frontend live in the same project.

- **File‑system based routing**
  - Routes are configured via the file system; no extra packages needed.
  - You have Page router and App router ( the newer approach )

- **Server‑side rendering (SSR) by default**
  - Pages are prerendered on the server.
  - The client receives finished HTML, which improves SEO.
